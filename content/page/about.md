## About

I am a mostly self-taught web developer, a painter, a writer, and an aspiring musician when I have spare time. Most web development technology I have learnt on my own time using online resources. My favorite programming language to work with is Ruby! But I have fun with C++, Python, or Javascript all the same

## School

College of New Caledonia - 2017 to 2020
I was a student at CNC for three years, at the time, I did not know exactly what I intended to focus on so I took a broad range of courses, mostly Sciences or English. I enjoyed computer science when I took it but I wasn't sure if I wanted to persue it further and switched to an arts degree with dreams of writing a novel. During this switch I took a year to complete the trades carpentry program offered at CNC, which still happens to be my "Highest" level of education.

Vancouver Island University - 2021 to Present
I currently am a student at VIU focusing heavily on computer science and software development. During the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do as a career, and began looking more at software development. I spent many months happily learning different languages and technologies and realised that this kinda of rewarding development experience is what I wanted to do. I am now happily enrolled in CSCI classes at VIU and am thuroughly enjoying a solidified sense of direction I never had before when I was studying at CNC.
