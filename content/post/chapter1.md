## Chapter 1

Skelemeus Krite was a wanderer, against his will. He follows whichever road takes him in a direction away from the fallen city of Pergola. Krite is a tall, imposing man, clad in a shirt of sturdy chainmail, with heavy plate boots and gauntlets covering all his edges, and a strong full faced helmet obscuring the Knights visage. His checkered orange and black tabard covered the bulk of his form, and the series of spade-like emblems marked Krite as a Knight of Pergola’s fierce calvary unit. The sword found strapped to Krites back would be an unusual choice for a cavalryman, if, of course, Krite was still riding horseback. On foot though, the flathead executioners’ blade was as imposing a weapon as any other, even if it was barely used. Within the scabbard, the blade was meticulously clean. 	Further down the cart-rutted dirt road, high shrieks flew down the wind, Krite lifted his attention from the stone he has been kicking down the path and picked up pace, eager to discover the origins of the sound. 

As Krite rounded a forested corner of the old road, two small figures were brought into view. A small boy, probably no older than fifteen, stood his ground against a mass of flesh and feathers on the road in front of him. The boy held a fishing knife in his shaking hands. The other figure, the feathers, was difficult for Krite to identify, slowly approaching, the sound of the Knights clattering armor alerted the feathered figure and the creatures head swiveled towards Krite, revealing a surprisingly humanoid face. A Harpy. Krite noticed a crude and bloodied arrow stuck deep in the flesh below the Harpy's shoulder. A tense shriek sounded from the Harpy's terrified face, apparently, it had been the sound of the Harpy which had attracted the lone Knight to this sad scene.

"Boy, step back." Krites voice was unexpectantly soft, and calm, for the build of the tall man, almost as if the speaker was unable to pump much air into his words, Krite had lockjaw. "It can't fly anywhere with the arrow in it, keep away from its claws."

The young boy glanced at the Knight, then over its shoulder at the pommel of the sword, before speaking. "It, the bird thing, it jumped out of the tree at me, it tried to get me." 
Krite moved forward, carefully urging the boy back with the palm of his hand, the Harpy let out another high shriek. "Before or after you shot an arrow at it?" Krite asked.
"Not me!" the boy protested. "I couldn't have if I wanted, I haven't got no bow."
Krite glanced down at the boy’s hands, then scanned the dirt of the road, and found no bow. "So, you don't." Krite inspected the Harpy once more, his gaze snuck past the feathered creature towards the tree that the Harpy must have jumped from, its base was speckled with stones. Krite turned away from the Harpy, towards the small boy. "Leave the Harpy to me, where is your home." Krite asked.
The Boy glanced between the Harpy and the Knight, uncertain, knife still shaking in his hands, before pointing away, further down the road. "My Pa says you need to kill stuff like those, it's a monster!" said the Boy. Ushering another shriek from the Harpy.
"*Does it speak common?*" thought the knight, inspecting the harpy's humanoid face. 
Krite turned to look down at the small boy’s eager face, his shoulders slumping to betray his disapproval. "It is only a monster if it chooses to be. Go now, find your father. I will make sure the bird doesn't harm you."
The young boy stood steadfast for a moment, but the harsh gaze of the orange knight made the child’s skin crawl, even if he couldn't see any eyes underneath the man’s helmet. After a moment’s hesitation, the boy ran off, heading down the path, towards home.
