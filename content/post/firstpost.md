## The Intent of this Blog

Hello, Welcome to my personal blog. This is my first post, and in theory the start of something great. Here I intend write technical posts on the different computer science topics I find myself studying during the week. This practice will be a great way to cement these ideas and concepts in my brain, as well as act as a helpful resource to anyone stumbling across my website interested in the topics I cover. 

I also want to include articles on personal projects I am working on here, documenting the different aspects of my life that I am passionate about would be a great way to keep momentum going and building the drive to continue to do the things I love. Personal posts would include content such as my writing, posts relating to my radio show or the process of running a radio show, reviews of different media or food, or whatever I see fit to write an article on.

## Schedule

I hope to write a technical article once a week, releasing on fridays, as well as a personal article every two weeks, on mondays.
